												<strong>Multiple Channels</strong> : In today's highly
												competitive market, selling through just one sales channel
												is usually not enough. In addition to their primary web
												store, most resellers do additional sales through eBay,
												Amazon etc. At Inventory Source, we thoroughly understand
												our customers and have designed Channel Manager to work
												across multiple sales channels. You can configure as many
												sales channels as you have and manage their orders and
												fulfillments from one central place.

												<strong>Automated Imports</strong> : Channel Manager automatically imports your orders from the configured channels so that you don't have to worry about checking orders at multiple places.  View alerts and easily edit orders with stock issues or those involving multiple supplier sources.

												<strong>Order File Uploads</strong> : One can also upload
												order files exported from your store or any other order
												management software. Channel Manager accepts all popular
												file formats by default. You can also configure any custom
												format in your Channel Manager account to import orders
												from.
