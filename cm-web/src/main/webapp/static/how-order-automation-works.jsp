												<strong>Multiple Channels</strong> : In today's highly
												competitive market, selling through just one sales channel
												is usually not enough. In addition to their primary web
												store, most resellers do additional sales through eBay,
												Amazon etc. At Inventory Source, we thoroughly understand
												our customers and have designed Channel Manager to work
												across multiple sales channels. You can configure as many
												sales channels as you have and manage their orders and
												fulfillments from one central place.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>Automated Imports</strong> : Channel Manager
												automatically imports your orders from the configured
												channels so that you don't have to worry about checking
												orders at multiple places. It also provides an option to NOT
												import the orders automatically and in that case, its just
												as easy as clicking a button.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>Order File Uploads</strong> : One can also upload
												order files exported from your store or any other order
												management software. Channel Manager accepts all popular
												file formats by default. You can also configure any custom
												format in your Channel Manager account to import orders
												from.

												<strong>Integrated Suppliers</strong> : Channel Manager has
												pre-built integrations with host of popular dropshippers
												like Moteng, Petra, Icella, D&amp;H and many more. Our
												engineering team is continously integrating more such
												suppliers so that you can just pick and choose the ones you
												need and start processing your orders.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>Custom Suppliers</strong> : In your chosen supplier
												is not in the list of integrated suppliers, Channel Manager
												provides you an ability to configure your own custom
												suppliers and automate order processing with them via email
												in any order file format.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>Supplier Mapping &amp; Manual Review</strong> : When
												Channel Manager receives an order from one of your channels,
												it automatically assigns to an appropriate dropshipper based
												on the supplier prefixes that you have configured in your
												channel settings. In the beginning, it is advisable to
												routinely review your orders before processing so as to make
												sure that your mappings are correctly configured.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong>Shipping Mappings</strong> : Almost all dropshippers
												have their own accepted shipping codes and methods. Mapping
												shipping codes from your various sales channels to the
												dropshippers of each order is a big problem faced by
												resellers. But not any more. <br /> Channel Manager lets
												you map your shipping methods from various channels to each
												supplier's accepted shipping codes. Once configured, you
												will never need to worry about it. Based on your mapping,
												Channel Manager will automatically determine the
												corresponding shipping code at the supplier to process the
												order.
